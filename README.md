# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

# To Do:
- [x] Add to do
- [x] Recover plugins from the plugins tracklist
- [x] Finish adding standart settings
- [ ] Add descriptions to the top of each file
- [x] Set up tmux configs (add nice window management shortcuts)
- [x] Move plugin tracker file to dotfiles??? (optional)
- [ ] Write a description of how is this maintained and used
- [x] ~~Symlinks vs sourcing files?~~ (symlinks for now)
- [ ] Create a list of dependencies and app used
- [ ] Write a script that would install all require dependecies
- [ ] Write a script for scheduling sleep and wake (use `pmset schedule`)
- [ ] Rewrite the setup script to be less error prone and to add clean up?
- [x] Ensure mouse support in both tmux and vim
